Task #1
Describe why the project is interesting to you
Solution









I'm interested in this project because I think it be very valuable software engeneering experience for me. The idea of creating an actual help for other developers to use and ease their work seems like great way to learn comercial software engeneering and improve coding and problem solving skills.
Task #2
What do you think about the project? What potential difficulties do you expect? How would you approach the problem if you were to start it from scratch?
Solution










Task #3
Implement the function ‘Optimize’ that accepts an expression and returns an equivalent expression that reuses duplicated elements:
interface IExpression;
interface IConstantExpression { int Value { get; } }
interface IVariableExpression { string Name { get; } }
interface IBinaryExpression { IExpression Left { get; } IExpression Right { get; } OperatorSign Sign { get; } }
interface IFunction { FunctionKind Kind { get; } IExpression Argument { get; } }

enum FunctionKind { Sin, Cos, Max }
enum OperatorSign { Plus, Minus, Multiply, Divide }

IExpression Optimize(IExpression expression)
{
  // implementation
}


For example, if the input encodes the following expression:
sin(7 * (2 + x)) - 7 * (2 + x) + cos(x)
The returned object should reuse expressions for ‘x’ and 7*(2+x)

Optional extra: Optimize semantically equivalent expressions - consider ‘2 + x’ the same as ‘x + 2’
